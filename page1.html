    <h1>About Cricket:</h1>
    <p>
        Cricket, often dubbed as the "gentleman's game," is a popular sport played across the globe, particularly in countries like India, Australia, England, and Pakistan. It is characterized by its unique combination of bat and ball, played between two teams of eleven players each on an oval-shaped field. The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, while the opposing team tries to dismiss the batsmen and restrict the scoring. Matches can last anywhere from a few hours in the case of Twenty20 cricket to five days in Test matches. Cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which oversees various formats of the game, including Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). It boasts a rich history dating back to the 16th century in England, evolving into a globally celebrated sport with passionate fans and players worldwide. Iconic tournaments such as the Cricket World Cup and the Indian Premier League (IPL) capture the imagination of millions of fans, showcasing thrilling contests between top teams and players. With its blend of strategy, skill, and athleticism, cricket continues to captivate audiences and hold a special place in the sporting landscape.
